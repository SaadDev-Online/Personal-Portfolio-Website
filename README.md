## Getting Started  
To get a local copy up and running follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaadDev‑Online/Personal‑Portfolio‑Website.git  
cd Personal‑Portfolio‑Website  
# Open index.html in your browser
(No build tools required — purely a static site unless otherwise)

Usage
Open index.html in your web browser to view the portfolio site.

To customise:

Replace images in assets/ with your own headshot, project screenshots, etc.

Modify styling in css/style.css (colors, fonts, layout).

Add new projects in the Projects section: update the HTML and possibly js/main.js if there's dynamic behaviour.

Deploy the site easily (e.g., via GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

Screenshots
(Insert your own screenshots for best effect, for example:)



Future Enhancements
Add a dark mode / theme toggle for user preference

Add animations or scroll‑triggered effects to enhance interactivity

Introduce CMS or data‑driven section so you can manage content without editing HTML directly

Add blog section or integration with an external API

Improve performance: lazy‑load images, use modern image formats (WebP/AVIF), minify CSS/JS
